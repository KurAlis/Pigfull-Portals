# Pigfull-Portals
The great and famous Bedrock Edition gold farm functionality but now on JAVA edition ! (check wiki)

*This mod is only required on the server-side*

## How to set up

You follow the normal setup guides for building a bedrock edition gold farm. You can find these online, for example on Youtube...

You can also use create mod or similar automation and storage mods to help you build it or adjust it to fit your needs.

## How to light up - IMPORTANT CHANGE

In this mod, the only difference is in the system that lights up the portal. You cant light it up like on bedrock.

**You have to place a sticky piston that pushes and pulls a netherack, powered by a redstone clock !**
*This system only works in overworld, for the need of that farm*

## Small Changes

The general structure of the farm should be the same, no changes needed other than the lighting-up system. The only thing i recommend is to use some kind of killing system that exists on Java edition or use some other mod that adds functionality.

**In summary: There is no trident killer feature added -yet.**

## Compatibility

This should be compatible with any other mod. It is widely tested on both server and singleplayer world sides. Most bugs have been fixed in the latest version.
It is recommended to use some of these mods but they are **NOT** required (they just help you in management and construction) - (these are based on 1.21.1 neoforge research) :
- Create Mod (+addons of your choice)
- Sophisticated storage or similar storage mods, maybe like AE2
- Constuction Wands (building made easier)
